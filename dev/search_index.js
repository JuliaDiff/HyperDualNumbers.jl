    "text": "Hyper-dual numbers can be used to compute first and second derivatives numerically without the cancellation errors of finite-differencing schemes.The initial Julia implementation (and up to v3.0.1) is directly based on the C++ implementation by Jeffrey Fike and Juan J Alonso, both of Stanford University, department of Aeronautics and Astronautics and is described in the paper:The Development of Hyper-Dual Numbers for Exact Second Derivative CalculationsThe early versions have been derived/written by Rob J Goedman (goedman@icloud.com).HyperDualNumbers.jl v4.0.0 has been completely redone by Benoit Pasquier and follows the structure of the JuliaDiff/DualNumbers package.]CurrentModule = HyperDualNumbers"
